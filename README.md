## Instructions for setting up local environment

### Prerequisites
1. Get admin rights to your machine
2. Get access to the source code management system


### One time setup (Draft)

1. **Install NVM**: We will use NVM to manage the versions of Node.js. Download NVM via curl command and make sure nvm is installed correctly.

  + **MacOS**: Run the following commands in a terminal

     ```
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash

    nvm --version
    ```
    Reference: [Installing NVM](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-node-js-tutorial-using-nvm-on-mac-os-x-and-ubuntu/)

  + **Windows**: NVM as known is for Mac/Linux only. For Windows, the idea is to install specific version of Node.js unless you want to try other alternatives.

2. **Install Node**: Install the specific version of Node.js for your project. Set that version as default. Run the following commands in a terminal.correctly.

  + **MacOS**: Run the following commands in a terminal
  
     ```
    nvm install 10.13.0
    nvm use v10.13.0
    nvm alias default v10.13.0
    node --version
    ```

  + **Windows**: Download the Node.js pre-built installer for your platform from  [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Select LTS Windows Installer (v10.13.0)
  
 
3. **Checkout Code**:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kpath/dmr-web.git
    ```
    __Note for Windows users:__ Run the follwing command to prevent line-ending issues

    ```
    git config --global core.autocrlf false
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Change directory to your project directory where you checked out the code and execute the following commands

    ```
    cd <project-dir>
    npm install
    ```

4. **Domain Setup**
 + **MacOS**: Add the lines on the right to your /etc/hosts file (requires admin privileges).

    ```
    127.0.0.1 dev.dmr.com
    ```
+ **Windows**: Add the above lines to c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts (requires admin privileges)
    
### Running the application
Open terminal window and execute

```
 npm run dev
 ```

### Accessing the site
